A restaurant should include:

<!-- - name
- specialty (italian, mexican, etc.)
- address
- an estimate of how expensive it is (this could be from one to five dollar signs, or just a string such as "cheap", "moderate", "expensive". -->
When a user rates it, they should enter a value from 1 to 5 stars and the amount of time that they had to wait for their food.

<!-- - As a user, I want to see a list of all the available restaurant names. -->
- When I click on a restaurant I want to see the other details about it.
- I would like to see only the restaurants of a particular specialty.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a restaurant record.
- As a user, I want to see the average wait time for each restaurant and the average rating.
